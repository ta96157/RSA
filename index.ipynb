    "- the number of desired bits (don't want a 0 bit in the position with the highest positional value), and \n",

    "If the prime candidate passes the first test, then a second test is performed. For very large prime candidates, it is impractical to check for divisibility of any prime number less than the candidate (and in fact for extremely large numbers we may not even know all of the prime numbers less than the candidate). This second test tells us if the proposed candidate is likely a prime number. To proceed with the assumption that it is requires that the test returns a high probability that the candidate is indeed prime.\n",

There is a finite list of integer exponents $n$ that will result in Mersenne primes, including $2, 3, 5, 7, 13, 17, 19, 31, \\ldots$. To date there are only 51 Mersenne primes known, but it has been conjectured that there are infinitely many that exist. (Cool huh?)"
