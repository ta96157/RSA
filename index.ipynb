    "### Public Key Generation\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step in RSA requires that we choose two prime numbers, $p$ and $q$. \n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, typically we would start by generating a prime candidate with the number of desired bits. One way to do this is to randomly generate each bit, and then set the first and last bits to 1. This ensures that the generated number has both:\n",
    "- the number of desired bits (don't want a 0 bit in the position with the highest positional value), and \n",
    "- is an odd number (even numbers are certainly not prime, except for 2 which is special).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Then we need to test if the generated prime candidate is indeed a prime number. This is not straightforward. Typically a first test would check if the prime candidate is divisible by any of the known smaller primes. If it is, then the generated candidate is rejected and we start again.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the prime candidate passes the first test, then a second test is performed. For very large prime candidates, it is impractical to check for divisibility of any prime number less than the candidate (and in fact for extremely large numbers we may not even know all of the prime numbers less than that number). This second test is not certain; it tells us only if the generated candidate is *likely* a prime number. To proceed with the assumption that the generated candidate is prime requires that the test return a high probability that the candidate is indeed prime. (In practice, the tolerance for uncertainty varies depending on the level of security required.)\n",
    "\n",
    "For toy examples, we can instead use theory that tells us how to construct sets of prime numbers. Here we generate two Mersenne primes: prime numbers that have the form $2^n-1$ for some integer $n$. There is a finite list of integer exponents $n$ that will result in Mersenne primes, including $2, 3, 5, 7, 13, 17, 19, 31, \\ldots$. To date there are only 51 Mersenne primes known, but it has been conjectured that there are in fact infinitely many. (Cool huh?)"
